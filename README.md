Role playing game in which the player will embark on adventures and fight various types of enemies


Dimension Fantasia Installation Readme

Provided in this folder is the complete unity project file that holds all the assets, scripts, logic and more that hold this game together.
Alternatively there is also a .zip file that contains all the assets used in the project in case Unity is not installed on the computer.
(If so, you can skip straight to the install portion of the readme).
The other file provided is an .apk file that is ready to be installed on any android device.

To load the unity project file to look at the assets, all that is needed is to install the Unity Hub (you also need to create an account with Unity and
obtain a personal license to be able to use the program. This is free. https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) and create a new 2D project.
Once Unity has fully opened, on the menu tab, click on Assets > Import Package > Custom Package... then locate the unitypackage file and click on it.
Once the initial load finishes, click on "Import" to import all the folders into the blank unity project.
This process may take several minutes, but once that process is done all the assets will be loaded into Unity's dashboard to observe.

You could try to build the game from Unity and create your own .apk, however that is not advised as there may be some technical issues that could arise.
If you do want to attempt to do so, import every scene in the "Scenes" folder into "Build Settings" (accessed by File > Build Settings). Make sure that
scene 0 is "Title" or else there could be some weird side effects. In "Build Settings" also be sure to switch the Platform to Android.

For the best experience, it is recommended to play Dimension Fantasia on a smartphone.

-----------------------------
To install Dimension Fantasia - (It is recommended to not build your own .apk due to potential glitches and to just install the .apk provided)
-----------------------------
Connect your Android device to a computer. Allow communications on your Android device and the PC and locate the .apk file included in this folder.
On the PC in a separate window, go to the file explorer and go to your Android device. At the root of the device, locate the "Download" (or equivalent) folder. 
Move the .apk file from the PC into that folder. Once the .apk has been moved, go onto the android device and go into a file manager app of your choice. 
(Your phone most likely comes with one by default but if not, you can download "Files by Google - by Google LLC" and follow these specific steps instead. 
Similar steps will apply to other file manager apps).

Inside Files by Google on the bottom of the app, go to "Browse", then click "Downloads" in categories. Once done, you should see the .apk supplied in this file
at the top of the list (look for the Knight doing a "peace" gesture). Once you find it, click on the file. Your device may try to prevent you from installing
the .apk due to it coming from an unknown source. If so, click on settings, then there should be a toggle to allow your device to install unknown apps.

Go back to the file manager. You may be prompted automatically to install it, if not click on the icon again to prompt an installation. Once installed
everything should be ready to go to play the game. Locate the app on either your home screen or your list of installed applications, and enjoy!

Alternatively, if there is an Android emulator of your choice on PC, you may install the .apk on there instead. (This instance LDPlayer will be the one used).
Install LDPlayer on your PC (from https://www.ldplayer.net/). Once installed, all that is needed is to click and drag the .apk file onto the LDPlayer home screen.
Once installed click on the Dimension Fantasia home screen and you are set. This may not be the ideal way to play due to questionable touch screen functionality,
however the option is there if you need it.
